9. [Machine learning with python from tutorials point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/machine_learning_with_python/index.htm) 

##### Machine learning, deep learning and related books :
1. The [Deep Learning textbook](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville, is a resource intended to help students and practitioners enter the field of machine learning in general and deep learning in particular. The **online version of the book is now complete and will remain available online for free**. 


##### Resources on Mathematics for machine learning and AI :
1. **MIT OCW** open source courses on :
    1. [Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8), by Gilbert Strang, is a basic subject on matrix theory and linear algebra. Emphasis is given to topics that will be useful in other disciplines, including systems of equations, vector spaces, determinants, eigenvalues, similarity, and positive definite matrices.
    2. [Computational Science & Engineering I](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF706B428FB7BD52C), by Gilbert Strang, provides a review of linear algebra, including applications to networks, structures, and estimation, Lagrange multipliers. Also covered are: differential equations of equilibrium; Laplace's equation and potential flow; boundary-value problems; minimum principles and calculus of variations; Fourier series; discrete Fourier transform; convolution; and applications.
    3. [Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP619EG1wp0kT-7rDE_Az5TNd) - provides students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems.
2. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is the place to do data science projects.
    - It has [courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) on data science and machine learning.
    - You can either [start a new project](https://www.kaggle.com/new-project) by exploring and forking one of their starter projects or [explore projects](https://www.kaggle.com/explore-projects) created by others.
    - You can also join [kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/challenge-yourself) where you can challange yourself with taking part in real world machine learning problem solving.
    - They also have a number of [publicly available datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) which you can practice with.
3. EdX and Coursera : online learning platforms
    - [AI for everyone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone) from deeplearning(dot)ai in coursera.
    - [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow) from deeplearning(dot)ai in coursera.
