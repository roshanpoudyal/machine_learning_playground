#### Machine Learning Playground
Repository to play and create projects related to machine learning and learn machine learning algorithms

##### Learning Resources :
1. [Curated path on how to get started with machine learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/).
2. [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer) breaks down complicated Statistics and Machine Learning methods into small, bite-sized pieces that are easy to understand.
3. [Siraj raval](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A/about) tries to inspire and educate developers to build Artificial Intelligence. Games, music, chatbots, art, i'll teach you how to make it all yourself. **He has many learning resources pointed out in his video descriptions**.
    - Here is his video on [Learn Machine Learning in 3 Months (with curriculum)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cr6VqTRO1v0).
    - Another video on [Learn Deep Learning in 6 Weeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qjNH1rDLm0).
4. [Lecture collection from Stanford University on Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv).
    - Here is the course on [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) on their official website.
5. [deeplearning.net](http://deeplearning.net/) website is intended to host a variety of resources and pointers to information about Deep Learning. In these pages you will find.
6. [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) is another freely available deeplearning resource.
7. [Data science tutorial from tutorials point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_data_science.htm).
8. [Machine learning with python from tutorials point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/machine_learning_with_python/index.htm) 

##### Machine learning, deep learning and related books :
1. The [Deep Learning textbook](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville, is a resource intended to help students and practitioners enter the field of machine learning in general and deep learning in particular. The **online version of the book is now complete and will remain available online for free**.
